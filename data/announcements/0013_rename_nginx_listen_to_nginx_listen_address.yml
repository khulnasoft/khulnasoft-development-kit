header: Renaming nginx.listen to nginx.listen_address
body: |
  The config key `nginx.listen` was renamed to `nginx.listen_address` to be
  consistent with other settings.

  If you have configured a `nginx.listen` in your `kdk.yml`, please rename
  `listen:` to `listen_address:`.

  See <https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/-/merge_requests/4082> for more details.
