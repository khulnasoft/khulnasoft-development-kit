# Pages

This page contains information about developing KhulnaSoft Pages inside the KDK. This method allows you test KhulnaSoft Pages from deployment to visiting your static site.

For further details check the [Contribute to KhulnaSoft Pages development](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/development/pages/).

## Port

KDK features an HTTP-only KhulnaSoft Pages daemon on port `3010`.
Port number can be customized by editing `kdk.yml` as explained in
[KDK configuration](../configuration.md#kdkyml).

## Hostname

In order to handle wildcard hostnames, pages integration relies on
[nip.io](https://nip.io) and does not work on a disconnected system.
This is the preferred configuration and the default value for the
KhulnaSoft Pages hostname is `127.0.0.1.nip.io`.

You can configure a custom host name. For example, to set up `pages.kdk.test`:

1. Set up the [`kdk.test` hostname](local_network.md).
1. Add the following to `kdk.yml`:

   ```yaml
   khulnasoft_pages:
     enabled: true
     host: pages.kdk.test
   ```

1. Also add `pages.kdk.test` as a hostname. For example, add the following to `/etc/hosts`:

   ```plaintext
   127.0.0.1 pages.kdk.test
   ```

However, to load your Pages domains, you must add an entry to the `/etc/hosts` file for
each domain you want to access. For example, to access `root.pages.kdk.test`, add the
following to `/etc/hosts`:

```plaintext
127.0.0.1 root.pages.kdk.test
```

That is because `/etc/hosts` does not support wildcard hostnames.
An alternative is to use [`dnsmasq`](https://wiki.debian.org/dnsmasq)
to handle wildcard hostnames.

## Enable access control

1. Follow steps 3-6 in [Enabling access control](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/development/pages/#enabling-access-control)
to create an OAuth application for KhulnaSoft Pages.

1. Add the following to `kdk.yml`

   ```yaml
   khulnasoft_pages:
     enabled: true
     access_control: true
     auth_client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID' # replace with OAuth Client ID generated above
     auth_client_secret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' # replace with OAuth Client Secret generated above
   ```

1. Reconfigure KDK

   ```shell
   kdk reconfigure
   ```

1. Restart KDK

   ```shell
   kdk restart
   ```

## Enable custom domains

1. Add the following to `kdk.yml`

   ```yaml
   khulnasoft_pages:
     enabled: true
     enable_custom_domains: true
   ```

1. Reconfigure KDK

   ```shell
   kdk reconfigure
   ```

1. Restart KDK

   ```shell
   kdk restart
   ```
