# Khulnasoft::Styles

`Khulnasoft::Styles` centralizes some shared KhulnaSoft's styles config (only RuboCop
for now), as well as custom RuboCop cops.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'khulnasoft-styles', require: false
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install khulnasoft-styles

## Usage

### Inherit all rules

Include the following in your `.rubocop.yml` and remove all the rules that are
already in `rubocop-default.yml`:

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  khulnasoft-styles:
    - rubocop-default.yml
```

### Inherit only some kind of rules

The rules are grouped by type so you can choose to inherit only some kind of
rules:

- `rubocop-all.yml`
- `rubocop-bundler.yml`
- `rubocop-gemspec.yml`
- `rubocop-layout.yml`
- `rubocop-lint.yml`
- `rubocop-migrations.yml`
- `rubocop-metrics.yml`
- `rubocop-naming.yml`
- `rubocop-performance.yml`
- `rubocop-rails.yml`
- `rubocop-rspec.yml`
- `rubocop-security.yml`
- `rubocop-style.yml`
- `rubocop-tailwind.yml`

Example:

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  khulnasoft-styles:
    - rubocop-gemspec.yml
    - rubocop-naming.yml
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To test some rules locally, there is a test application [in the playground folder](./playground/). It is a vanilla Rails 6 application with your local `khulnasoft-styles` included, and it is used to test RuboCop rules. You can add code in it (preferably RuboCop offenses) and run the following command to test the RuboCop policy we setup:

```shell
cd playground
bundle install
bundle exec rubocop -c .rubocop.yml
```

### Activate lefthook locally

```shell
lefthook install
```

## Release Process

We release `khulnasoft-styles` on an ad-hoc basis. There is no regularity to when
we release, we just release when we make a change - no matter the size of the
change.

To release a new version:

1. Create a Merge Request.
1. Use Merge Request template [Release.md](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/tree/main/khulnasoft-styles/-/blob/master/.khulnasoft/merge_request_templates/Release.md).
1. Follow the instructions.
1. After the Merge Request has been merged, a new gem version is [published automatically](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/components/gem-release).
1. Once the new gem version is visible on [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/khulnasoft-styles), it is recommended to update [KhulnaSoft's `Gemfile`](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/khulnasoft/-/blob/master/Gemfile) to bump the `khulnasoft-styles` Ruby gem to the new version also.

See [!123](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/tree/main/khulnasoft-styles/-/merge_requests/123) as an example.
