header: Vault support dropped
body: |
  As of October 4th, we've dropped support for Vault in KDK because of
  HashCorp licensing changes and our move to the open source OpenBao.

  If you are using Vault in KDK, please switch to OpenBao. See doc/howto/openbao.md.

  For more details, see: <https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/-/issues/2231>
