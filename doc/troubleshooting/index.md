# Troubleshooting KDK

Many problems caused by switching branches can be resolved by updating Node.js
modules, Ruby gems, and performing database migrations.

Before attempting the specific troubleshooting steps documented below, try running the following commands first:

  ```shell
  cd <kdk-dir>/khulnasoft
  yarn install && bundle install
  bundle exec rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
  ```

For more information about how to update KDK, see [Update KDK](../../doc/kdk_commands.md#update-kdk).

## Get the debug output

The `kdk_debug` setting turns on debugging mode, which provides verbose output logs to help you fix errors.
To get the debug output from `make` commands, append `kdk_debug=true`:

  ```shell
  make kdk_debug=true
  ```

## Installing the KDK

### No keyserver available

If you see the following error while `asdf` tries to install dependencies as part of the KDK installation:

```shell
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  3490    0  3490    0     0  45921      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 45921
gpg: keyserver receive failed: Network is unreachable
gpg: keyserver receive failed: No keyserver available
[...]
ERROR: Failed to install some asdf tools.
```

You can fix it by running:

```shell
echo "standard-resolver" >  ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf
sudo pkill dirmngr
```

See this [issue](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs/issues/192) for more details.

### `icuc4` setup failed during `make .khulnasoft-translations` in KDK installation

If you encounter an `icuc4` setup error during the `make .khulnasoft-translations` step of KDK installation, try the following steps:

1. Upgrade Xcode to the latest version.
1. Run `brew cleanup` to clean up any unnecessary files.
1. Run `brew upgrade` to upgrade outdated packages.
1. Open a new terminal window and continue with the installation of KDK.

### PostgreSQL socket creation failed due to KDK directory path being too long

If you encounter a PostgreSQL socket creation failure, it might be because Gitaly is unable to create a Unix socket due to your KDK directory path exceeding the supported character limit.

To fix this issue, try moving the KDK directory to a location with a shorter directory path, then continue with your KDK setup.

## Git

The following are possible solutions to problems you might encounter with Git and KDK.

### 'Invalid reference name' when creating a new tag

Make sure that `git` is configured correctly on your development
machine (where KDK runs).

```shell
git checkout -b can-I-commit
git commit --allow-empty -m 'I can commit'
```

### `fatal: not a git repository`

If any `kdk` command gives you the following error:

```plaintext
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

Make sure you don't have `kdk` aliased in your shell.
For example the Git module in [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
has an [alias](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/master/modules/git/README.md#data)
for `kdk` that lists killed files.

## Puma

The following are possible solutions to problems you might encounter with Puma and KDK.

### An error has occurred and reported in the system's low-level handler

If you receive this error message:

```plaintext
An error has occurred and reported in the system's low-level error handler.
```

This is [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) catching an error that has slipped through from Rails. Here are some suggestions that may assist:

- Completely stop your KDK to rule out an out-of-date process running:

  ```shell
  kdk stop && kdk kill && kdk start
  ```

- Update your KDK as the problem may have already been fixed:

  ```shell
  kdk update && kdk restart
  ```

- If the problem continues to persist, please raise a KDK Issue ensuring all detail requested in the Issue template is provided.

### Puma timeout

Browser shows `EOF`. Logs show a timeout:

```plaintext
error: GET "/users/sign_in": badgateway: failed after 62s: EOF
```

Depending on the performance of your development environment, Puma may
time out. Increase the timeout as a workaround.

Use environment variables to override the default timeout:

Variable | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | -----------
`KHULNASOFT_RAILS_RACK_TIMEOUT` | integer | Sets `service_timeout`
`KHULNASOFT_RAILS_WAIT_TIMEOUT` | integer | Sets `wait_timeout`

## Sidekiq Cluster

KDK uses Sidekiq Cluster (running a single Sidekiq process) by default instead
`bundle exec sidekiq` directly, which is a step towards making development a
bit more like production.

Technically, running Sidekiq Cluster with a single Sidekiq process matches the same behavior
of running Sidekiq directly, but eventually problems may arise.

If you're experiencing performance issues or jobs not being picked up, try disabling
Sidekiq Cluster by:

1. Stopping all running processes with `kdk stop`.
1. Opening the `$KDKROOT/Procfile` file.
1. Removing the `SIDEKIQ_WORKERS` environment variable from `rails-background-jobs`.
1. Starting KDK again with `kdk start`.

When doing so, please create an issue describing what happened.

## Jaeger

If you're seeing errors such as:

```shell
ERROR -- : Failure while sending a batch of spans: Failed to open TCP connection to localhost:14268 (Connection refused - connect(2) for "localhost" port 14268)
```

This is most likely because Jaeger is not configured in your `$KDKROOT/Procfile`.
The easiest way to fix this is by re-creating your `Procfile` and then running
a `kdk reconfigure`:

1. `mv Procfile Procfile.old; make Procfile`
1. `kdk reconfigure`

For more information about Jaeger, visit the
[distributed tracing KhulnaSoft developer documentation](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/development/distributed_tracing.html).

## Gitaly

The following are possible solutions to problems you might encounter with Gitaly and KDK.

### `config.toml: no such file or directory`

If you see errors such as:

```shell
07:23:16 gitaly.1                | time="2019-05-17T07:23:16-05:00" level=fatal msg="load config" config_path=<path-to-kdk>/gitaly/gitaly.config.toml error="open <path-to-kdk>/gitaly/gitaly.config.toml: no such file or directory"
```

Somehow, `gitaly/gitaly.config.toml` is missing. You can re-create this file by running
the following in your KDK directory:

```shell
make gitaly-setup
```

### Git fails to compile within Gitaly project

If you see the following error when running a `kdk update`:

```shell
ld: library not found for -lgit2
```

A known fix is to clean your Go cache by running the following from the KDK's root
directory:

```shell
go clean -cache
rm -rf gitaly
```

Now rerun `kdk update`.

### `libegit2.a Error 129`

If you see the following error when running a `kdk install` or a `kdk update`:

```shell
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/user/khulnasoft-development-kit/gitaly; error: unknown option `initial-branch=master'
make[1]: *** [Makefile:424: /home/user/khulnasoft-development-kit/gitaly/_build/deps/libgit2/install/lib/libgit2.a] Error 129
```

Check which version of Git you're running with `git --version`, and compare it against
[KhulnaSoft requirements](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/install/requirements.html#git-versions). You
might be running an unsupported version.

If the supported version is not available for you from pre-compiled packages, try following the
instructions for:

- [Ubuntu or Debian](../index.md#ubuntu-or-debian).
- [Arch and Manjaro](../index.md#arch-and-manjaro-linux).

If that doesn't give you the supported version, you might have to [compile Git from source](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/install/installation.html#git).

## Elasticsearch

Running a spec locally may give you something like the following:

```shell
rake aborted!
Khulnasoft::TaskFailedError: # pkg-config --cflags  -- icu-i18n icu-i18n
Package icu-i18n was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `icu-i18n.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'icu-i18n' found
Package icu-i18n was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `icu-i18n.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'icu-i18n' found
pkg-config: exit status 1
make: *** [build] Error 2
```

This indicates that Go is trying to link (unsuccessfully) to brew's `icu4c`.

Find the directory where `icu-i18n.pc` resides:

- On macOS, using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), it is generally in `/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig` or `/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig`
- On Ubuntu/Debian it might be in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig`
- On Fedora it is expected to be in `/usr/lib64/pkgconfig`

You need to add that directory to the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

To fix this now, run the following on the command line:

```shell
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
```

To fix this for the future, add the line above to `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`.

### Elasticsearch indexer looks for the wrong version of icu4c

You might get the following error when updating the application:

```plaintext
# khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/khulnasoft-elasticsearch-indexer
/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.14.2_1/libexec/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64/link: running clang failed: exit status 1
ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/64.2/lib'
ld: library not found for -licui18n
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

make[1]: *** [build] Error 2
make: *** [khulnasoft-elasticsearch-indexer/bin/khulnasoft-elasticsearch-indexer] Error 2
```

This means Go is trying to link to brew's version of `icu4c` (`64.2` in the example), and failing.
This can happen when `icu4c` is not pinned and got updated. Verify the version with:

```shell
$ ls /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c
66.1
```

Clean Go's cache to fix this error. From the KDK's root directory:

```shell
cd khulnasoft-elasticsearch-indexer/
go clean -cache
```

## Homebrew

Most `brew` problems can be figured out by running:

```shell
brew doctor
```

However, older installations may have significant cruft leftover from previous
installations and updates. To manually remove outdated downloads for all
formulae, casks, and stale lock files, run:

```shell
brew cleanup
```

For more information on uninstalling old versions of a formula, see the [Homebrew FAQ](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#how-do-i-uninstall-old-versions-of-a-formula).
For additional troubleshooting information, see the Homebrew [Common Issues](https://docs.brew.sh/Common-Issues) page.

## Live reloading

If you previously compiled production assets with `bundle exec rake khulnasoft:assets:compile`, the KDK
serves the assets from the `public/assets/` directory, which means that changing SCSS files doesn't
have any effect in development until you recompile the assets manually.

To re-enable live reloading of CSS in development, remove the `public/assets/` directory and restart
KDK.

## Praefect

### get shard for "default": primary is not healthy

From the KDK's root directory:

```shell
cd gitaly/ruby
bundle install
```

You may need to run a `kdk restart` for the changes to take effect.

### `/home/user/khulnasoft-development-kit/gitaly/_build/bin/praefect`: No such file or directory

You might encounter the following error while running Gitaly database migrations:

```shell
support/migrate-praefect: line 4: /home/user/khulnasoft-development-kit/gitaly/_build/bin/praefect: No such file or directory
migrate failed
make: *** [_postgresql-seed-praefect] Error 1
```

This means `/gitaly/_build/bin/praefect` is missing. To re-create this executable file, run the following in your KDK directory:

```shell
make gitaly-update
```

## Updating the KDK

### Run `kdk doctor`

As a general rule, if you encounter errors when you run `kdk update`, you should run `kdk doctor` and follow the suggestions it
returns. They might resolve your issue.

### Blank page after update

If you encounter a blank page after performing an update, this is because of a hanging process. To solve the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the hanging process ID (PID) bound to port `3000`:

   ```script
   lsof -i tcp:3000
   ```

1. Using the returned PID, kill the hanging process:

   ```shell
   kill -9 <process id>
   ```

1. Restart KDK services:

   ``` shell
   kdk restart
   ```

If you've changed your default port, use the following command to find your custom port number: `kdk config get port`

### Error due to `Net::OpenTimeout: Failed to open TCP connection to rubygems.org:443`

When you run `kdk update` you might get an error like the following:

```plaintext
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError)
```

This indicates that `bundle` failed to connect to the `rubygems.org` server.

If you are connected to the network and other network activities are working (i.e. `ping khulnasoft.com`), then this normally indicates
an outage of `rubygems.org`. You can try manually running `bundle update` in the KDK root folder, and if it fails with a similar
network error, you know this is the cause.

However, in some cases, even though `bundle update` is otherwise working successfully, you might get an error like the following:

```plaintext
INFO: Installing khulnasoft-development-kit Ruby gem..
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError)
    Net::OpenTimeout: Failed to open TCP connection to rubygems.org:443 (execution expired) (https://rubygems.org/specs.4.8.gz)
```

This can happen if the IPv6 access to `rubygems.org` is having an outage, but IPv4 access is still working.

Using [this comment](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2662#issuecomment-779730989) as an example, you can add `:ipv4_fallback_enabled: true` to your `~/.gemrc` to work around this until [this rubygems pull request](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/4038) gets merged.

If that doens't work for some reason, you can alternately go into your operating system network settings and disable IPv6 for your network adapter. Refer to your
operating system documentation for detailed instructions.

## Starting the KDK

### Unable to start as CE (FOSS_ONLY)

If your KDK enters an infinite loop when running `FOSS_ONLY=1 kdk start`, try to remove `- { name: 'group_saml' }` option from your `config/khulnasoft.yml`. The favicon should be blue when in CE and green when in EE.

### Error due to `ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken`

If you encounter an `ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken` error when starting KDK, try the following steps:

- Hard refresh your browser to clear the cache. For more information, see [How to hard refresh your browser](https://fabricdigital.co.nz/blog/how-to-hard-refresh-your-browser-and-clear-cache).
- Stop all KDK processes using `kdk kill`, then restart KDK with `kdk start`.
- Delete all browser cache, cookies, local storage, and other related data for the relevant hostname.

### Error starting `timeout: down: /Users/foo/kdk/services/rails-background-jobs: 0s, want up`

Check if a background job process is unexpectedly running:

- Search for processes related to background jobs: `ps aux | grep rails-background-jobs`
- If runit is currently trying to start `rails-background-jobs` then you may find: `runsvdir -P /Users/foo/kdk/services log: atal: unable to lock supervise/lock: temporary failure\012runsv rails-background-jobs: fatal: unable to lock supervise/lock: temporary failure\012runsv rails-background-jobs: fatal: unable to lock supervise/lock: temporary failure\012runsv rails-background-jobs: fatal: unable to lock supervise/lock: temporary failure\012runsv rails-background-jobs: fatal: unable to lock supervise/lock: temporary failure\012`
- Stop KDK services: `kdk stop`
- If `ps aux | grep rails-background-jobs` shows that `runsv rails-background-jobs` is still running, then it is preventing `rails-background-jobs` from starting
- Kill the process by following [Stopping and restarting the KDK](#stopping-and-restarting-the-kdk)

If the above is not the problem, then confirm you can run `rails-background-jobs` manually: `RAILS_ENV=development ./bin/background_jobs start_foreground`.

### Error `Listen::Error::INotifyMaxWatchesExceeded`

Depending on your system configuration, you can receive errors about an excess or maximum number of inotify watchers. This error can appear when running `kdk tail`.

To solve this problem, increase the maximum allowed inotify watchers. For more information, see
[relevant documentation for the `listen` gem](https://github.com/guard/listen/blob/master/README.md#increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers).

### Page loading issue due to ad blocker

Some ad blockers, such as uBlock Origin, might prevent `web-vitals.js` from loading properly.
This results in errors such as:

```shell
Failed to load 'pages.projects.jobs.index.js' entrypoint
```

To resolve this issue, disable your ad blocker and reload the application.

## Stopping and restarting the KDK

Sometimes the KDK will fail to stop or restart. This is sometimes caused by processes not shutting down gracefully and can prevent subsequent attempts to stop/start the KDK.

You might see something like the following after running `kdk stop`:

```shell
kill: run: ./services/rails-background-jobs: (pid 89668) 98s, normally down, want down
```

To kill off the rogue processes, run `kdk kill`.

## Unable to log in as root

If all the services are running after you run `kdk install`, but you cannot log
in as `root`, you can reset the password through the Rails console.

For more information about the Ruby on Rails console in KhulnaSoft, see [Rails console](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/administration/operations/rails_console.html).

1. Open a new Rails console:

   ```shell
   cd <kdk-dir>/khulnasoft
   bundle exec rails console
   ```

1. In the Rails console, update the password for the `root` user:

   ```ruby
   user = User.find_by_username('root')
   user.update!(password: 'newpassword')
   ```

To find the user IDs for all current users, run:

```ruby
User.all
```

## Orphaned `workerd` processes

Sometimes, `workerd` hangs and prevents KDK from working. You can try and kill
all `workerd` processes:

```shell
killall -9 workerd
```

If that doesn't help, you can try [disabling `khulnasoft-http-router`](../howto/cells.md#disabling-the-http-router).
