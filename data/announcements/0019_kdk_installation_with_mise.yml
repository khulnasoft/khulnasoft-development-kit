header: KDK installation now supports mise as active version manager
body: |
  You can now select [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) as the default tool version manager during KDK installation. This means you no longer need to switch to mise from asdf after installation.

  To install KDK with mise, please run:

  ```
  curl "https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/-/raw/main/support/install" | bash
  ```

  For more details, see <https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/-/issues/2346>.
