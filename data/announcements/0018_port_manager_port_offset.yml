header: CellsPortManager consolidated with PortManager
body: |
  The `CellsPortManager` is merged into the existing `PortManager`.

  In this process `port_offset` configuration setting is added and
  `cells.port_offset` is **deprecated**. See
  https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/-/issues/2309

  To sync all cells please run:

    ```shell
    kdk cells up && kdk cells update
    ```
