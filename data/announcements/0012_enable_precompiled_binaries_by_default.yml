header: Pre-compiled binaries are now enabled by default for KhulnaSoft Workhorse
body: |
  KDK now downloads and uses pre-compiled binaries for KhulnaSoft Workhorse by default.
  This change speeds up the setup and update process by removing the need to compile from source.

  If you're working directly on KhulnaSoft Workhorse and need to compile them locally, please disable the pre-compiled binaries by running the following command:

  ```
  kdk config set khulnasoft_workhorse.skip_compile false
  ```

  After that, run `kdk update` to apply the new settings.

  For more details, see https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/-/issues/2228.
