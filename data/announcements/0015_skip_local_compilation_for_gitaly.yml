header: Pre-compiled binaries are now enabled by default for Gitaly
body: |
  KDK now downloads and uses pre-compiled binaries for Gitaly by default.
  This change speeds up the setup and update process by removing the need to compile from source.

  If you're working directly on Gitaly and need to compile them locally, please disable the pre-compiled binaries by running the following command:

  ```
  kdk config set gitaly.skip_compile false
  ```

  After that, run `kdk update` to apply the new settings.
