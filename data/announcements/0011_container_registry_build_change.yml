header: Container registry now built from source and runs as a local service
body: |
  The container registry will now be built from source and run as a local service, instead of being run via a Docker container. This change improves the registry's access to other KDK services like PostgreSQL and Redis, which were previously harder to connect due to the Docker-based setup.

  No additional configuration is needed to benefit from this change.
