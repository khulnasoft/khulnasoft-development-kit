# KhulnaSoft Agent Server (KAS)

If you wish to clone and keep an updated [KhulnaSoft Agent for Kubernetes](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/cluster-integration/khulnasoft-agent) as part of your KDK, do the following:

1. Install [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/)

   The recommended way to install Bazel is to use [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk). Bazelisk is a version manager for Bazel, much like `rbenv` for Ruby. For
   information on installing Bazelisk, see the [installation instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-bazelisk.html). If you follow the installation
   instructions for a Linux system, rename the Bazelisk binary executable to `bazel`.

1. Add the following settings in your `kdk.yml`:

   ```yaml
   khulnasoft_k8s_agent:
     enabled: true
   ```

1. (Optional) To use the [CI tunnel](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/ci_cd_workflow.html) functionality, you must:
   1. Enable [NGINX](nginx.md) in HTTPS mode. `kubectl` never sends credentials over a plain
      text connection.
   1. Specify concrete IP addresses for `kas` to listen on. `kdk.yml` looks like this
      (assuming [loopback alias IP](local_network.md#create-loopback-interface) was set up):

      ```yaml
      khulnasoft_k8s_agent:
        enabled: true
        agent_listen_address: 172.16.123.1:8150
        k8s_api_listen_address: 172.16.123.1:8154
      hostname: kdk.test
      port: 3443
      https:
        enabled: true
      nginx:
        enabled: true
        ssl:
          certificate: kdk.test.pem
          key: kdk.test-key.pem
      ```

1. Run `kdk update` to get `kas` installed as part of KDK.

1. Run `kdk reconfigure` to update various configuration files.

1. You can start KDK with `kdk start`. It prints the URL for `agentk` to use:

   ```plaintext
   => KhulnaSoft available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.
   => KhulnaSoft Agent Server (KAS) available at grpc://127.0.0.1:8150.
   ```

   If you are using NGINX+HTTPS, the URL would show something like:

   ```plaintext
   => KhulnaSoft available at https://kdk.test:3443.
   => KhulnaSoft Agent Server (KAS) available at wss://kdk.test:3443/-/kubernetes-agent.
   ```

1. To verify that `kas` is running you can:
   - Run `kdk tail khulnasoft-k8s-agent` to check the logs. You should see no errors in the logs. Empty logs are normal too.
   - Run `curl 127.0.0.1:8150`. It should print

     ```plaintext
     Warning: Binary output can mess up your terminal. Use "--output -" to tell
     Warning: curl to output it to your terminal anyway, or consider "--output
     Warning: <FILE>" to save to a file.
     ```

     This is normal because gRPC is a binary protocol.

   - If running with NGINX enabled, run using the loopback address: `curl 172.16.123.1:8150`. It should print

     ```plaintext
     WebSocket protocol violation: Connection header "close" does not contain Upgrade
     ```

     This is a normal response from `kas` for such a request because it's expecting a WebSocket connection upgrade.

1. Once your KhulnaSoft Agent Server is running, you can connect to a Kubernetes cluster by
   [installing `agentk` to the cluster](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/index.html#install-the-agent-in-the-cluster).
   The `kasAddress` should be the KhulnaSoft Agent Server URL outputted when you ran `kdk start` or from the listed URLs when you run `kdk status`.

   - To connect to a Kubernetes cluster on `k3d`, read the instructions below for [deploying `agentk` with `k3d`](#optional-deploy-the-khulnasoft-agent-agentk-with-k3d)

## (Optional) Connecting your project to `agentk` using CI Tunnel

The KhulnaSoft Agent Server communicates with `agentk` through a Kubernetes proxy. You can check the proxy address by running `kdk status`, which will output it as one of the URLs:

```plaintext
=> KhulnaSoft available at https://kdk.test:3443.
=> KhulnaSoft Agent Server (KAS) available at wss://kdk.test:3443/-/kubernetes-agent.
=> Kubernetes proxy (via KAS) available at https://kdk.test:3443/-/k8s-proxy/.
```

The [KhulnaSoft Runner](runner.md) must be authorized to access the `https` address. This is done by adding the NGINX SSL certificate to the relevant places.

### Runner configuration

If your runner is configured with a `docker` executor, you must add your certificate to the volumes in your runner's `config.toml`:

```plaintext
[[runners]]
  name = "KDK local runner"
  url = "https://kdk.test:3443"
  # other config here
  [runners.docker]
  volumes = [
    "path/to/kdk/directory/kdk.test.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/kdk.test.crt",
    # other volumes here
    "/certs/client",
    "/cache"
  ]
```

Alternatively, you can set the `certificate-authority` of `agentk`'s Kubernetes cluster:

1. Add the `kdk.test` certificate into your project that is using CI Tunnel. You can also use the root certificate if there is one. For
   example, the `rootCA.pem` file generated by `mkcert`.

   1. Copy the contents of the certificate to the clipboard
   1. Add a [`File` type CI/CD variable](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/ci/variables/#use-file-type-cicd-variables) in your project.
      For example: key is `CA_CRT`, value is content of `.pem` or `.crt` file, and type is `File`. Unset all flags.

1. In the project's `.khulnasoft-ci.yml`, for steps that need to connect to `agentk` (e.g.: the deploy step), add a command to set the certificate authority of the associated Kubernetes cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl config set clusters.khulnasoft.certificate-authority $CA_CRT
   ```

   This reads the certificate that you added to your project.

   An example `.khulnasoft-ci.yml`, extended from [this guide](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/ci_cd_workflow.html#update-your-khulnasoft-ciyml-file-to-run-kubectl-commands), looks like this:

   ```yaml
   deploy:
     image:
       name: bitnami/kubectl:latest
       entrypoint: ['']
     script:
       - kubectl config get-contexts
       - kubectl config use-context path/to/project:agentk-name
       - kubectl config set clusters.khulnasoft.certificate-authority $CA_CRT
       - kubectl get pods --namespace khulnasoft-agent
   ```

## (Optional) Deploy the KhulnaSoft Agent (agentk) with k3d

1. [Install k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d#get).
1. Create a k3d cluster:

   ```shell
   k3d cluster create
   ```

1. Set up a [loopback alias IP](local_network.md#create-loopback-interface). We can use it as the
   listen address so that `agentk` can reach your local KhulnaSoft and KAS. Let's assume this is `172.16.123.1`.
   We recommend you also bind your hostname to this address in `/etc/hosts`, by adding the line
   `172.16.123.1 kdk.test` to `/etc/hosts`

   Then update your `kdk.yml` to include these global keys:

   ```yaml
   hostname: kdk.test
   listen_address: "172.16.123.1"
   ```

   This sets the default hostname and listen address for all KDK services, including KhulnaSoft.
   For example, with the default ports:

   - KhulnaSoft would now be available on `http://kdk.test:3000`.
   - The registry would now be available on `https://kdk.test:5000`.

1. Run `kdk reconfigure` to apply the above change.
1. Deploy `agentk`:

   1. [Register the agent](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/index.html#register-the-agent-with-khulnasoft) as you normally would to deploy it to any cluster. Take note of the token.
   1. [Install the Agent to the cluster](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/index.html#install-the-agent-in-the-cluster).

      At this step, be sure to use the loopback alias as the KAS address instead of the `kdk.test` URL. This is necessary because `k3d` is running on Docker, which will not be able to resolve `kdk.test`.

      You can do this by changing the `config.kasAddress` in the Helm installation command:

      ```shell
      helm upgrade --install agentk-test khulnasoft/khulnasoft-agent \
      --namespace khulnasoft-agent \
      --create-namespace \
      --set image.tag=v15.4.0 \
      --set config.token=<token generated from the previous step> \
      --set config.kasAddress=grpc://172.16.123.1:8150
      ```

## (Optional) Run `agentk` from source using `support/agentk`

To increase development velocity, KDK includes a script `support/agentk` to run
agentk with `go run`, skipping the build and deploy steps associated with
running `agentk` in a cluster. The script takes a single mandatory argument, the
agent token, and runs the agent in the foreground:

```shell
support/agentk TOKEN [EXTRA ARGS FOR AGENTK]
```

When run in this way, `agentk` implicitly uses the currently selected context in
your kubeconfig, similar to how `kubectl` works.

To pick up new changes to the code, simply restart the script. If you are also making changes to KAS, consider running
[KAS from source as well](#optional-run-kas-directly-from-source-with-go-run).

When running the script, all arguments following the token get forwarded
directly to `agentk`. For example, to use a different kubeconfig context, you
can use the `--context` flag:

```shell
support/agentk TOKEN --context YOUR_CONTEXT
```

To see the list of available flags, you can run

```shell
support/agentk "" --help
```

## (Optional) Run using Bazel instead of KDK

If you want to run KhulnaSoft Agent Server and Agent locally with Bazel instead of KDK, see
the [KhulnaSoft Agent documentation](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/cluster-integration/khulnasoft-agent/-/blob/master/doc/developing.md#running-the-agent-locally).

## (Optional) Developing KAS observability together with KhulnaSoft Observability Stack's development environment

To develop observability features of KAS, you can configure KDK and KAS so that traces are sent to a development instance of KhulnaSoft Observability Stack (GOS).

To configure KDK and KAS:

1. Launch a [devvm](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/opstrace/devvm/) - integrated development environment for GOS.
1. Once all the steps required to launch devvm are completed, note the KhulnaSoft groupID that was provisioned.
   You can find it in the output of the `booter` script - please refer to [the devvm documentation](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/opstrace/devvm/#start-monitoring-the-progress-of-booter).
   This is referred to as `<khulnasoft groupID>` in this document.
1. Create a KhulnaSoft Observability Stack API token.
   1. In the web browser, enter `https://gob.devvm/-/<khulnasoft groupID>/`, for example `https://gob.devvm/-/22/`.
   1. On the left sidebar, select **Configuration > API Keys**.
   1. Select **New API Key**.
   1. Enter a title for the key, select the **User** role, and then select **Add**.
   1. Copy the created API key. You will use it in a later step.
1. Log into the `devvm`. All the following steps must be executed from the `dev` user inside `devvm`.
1. Store the API token in a file:

   ```shell
   echo <token> > /home/dev/otel-token.txt
   ```

1. Perform steps required to [run KAS from within KDK](#khulnasoft-agent-server-kas).
1. Configure the `kubectl` plugin for `asdf`:

   ```shell
   asdf list kubectl | sort -n | head -n 1 | xargs -I{} asdf global kubectl {}
   ```

1. Fetch the CA certificate that GOB (KhulnaSoft Observability Backend) uses:

   ```shell
   KUBECONFIG=/home/dev/kubeconfig kubectl get secret self-signed-ca-secret -o jsonpath='{ .data.ca\.crt }' | base64 -d > /home/dev/khulnasoft-development-kit/gob-ca.crt
   ```

1. Add [OTel](https://opentelemetry.io/) configuration to `kdk.yml`:

   ```yaml
   khulnasoft_k8s_agent:
     <...>
     otlp_endpoint: https://gob.devvm/v1/traces/<khulnasoft groupID>
     otlp_token_secret_file: /home/dev/otel-token.txt
     otlp_ca_certificate_file: /home/dev/khulnasoft-development-kit/gob-ca.crt
     <...>
   ```

1. Uninstall the `asdf` installation of Go to avoid issues:

   ```shell
   asdf uninstall golang 1.19.3
   ```

   Sign out and sign back in to the `dev` account in order for changes to take effect.
   You should be using now the system version of Go:

   ```shell
   $ which go
   /usr/bin/go
   ```

1. Reconfigure KDK:

   ```shell
   kdk reconfigure
   ```

1. Configure KDK to use the CA certificate when deploying `agentk`.

   ```shell
   export KUBECONFIG=/home/dev/kubeconfig
   helm repo add khulnasoft https://charts.khulnasoft.io
   helm repo update
   helm upgrade --install mynamespace khulnasoft/khulnasoft-agent \
      --namespace khulnasoft-agent-mynamespace \
      --create-namespace \
      --set image.tag=v15.7.0-rc1 \
      --set config.token=<...> \
      --set config.kasAddress=wss://kdk.devvm:3443/-/kubernetes-agent \
      --set config.caCert="$(cat /home/dev/khulnasoft-development-kit/kdk.devvm.pem)"
   ```

1. Deploy the agent by following the steps in [Installing the agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/).
   To keep things simple, you should deploy the agent on the same Kubernetes cluster that GOB is running on.
1. Test if traces are properly received.
   1. In the web browser, enter `https://gob.devvm/-/<khulnasoft groupID>`.
   1. On the left sidebar, expand **Explore**, and select **Explore > Traces**.
   If you can see a section named `khulnasoft-kas`, then the traces are being ingested by GOB.

## (Optional) Run KAS directly from source (with `go run`)

When working on KAS, it can be convenient to run directly from source instead of
having to rebuild every time.

```shell
kdk config set khulnasoft_k8s_agent.run_from_source true
kdk reconfigure
```

That way, changes to the code get picked up immediately every time you restart
KAS:

```shell
kdk restart khulnasoft-k8s-agent
```

## (Optional) Run KAS manually

When working on KAS, it can be convenient to run KAS manually instead of running it through the KDK `Procfile`.
For example, this method can be ideal if you want to run KAS with a debugger, directly from the IDE, or run multiple KAS replicas.

```shell
kdk config set khulnasoft_k8s_agent.configure_only true
kdk reconfigure
```

## (Optional) Disable automatic repository updates

When working on the agent, you probably want to manage the repository on your
own, to avoid having `kdk update` stash your changes:

```shell
kdk config set khulnasoft_k8s_agent.auto_update false
kdk reconfigure
```

## (Optional) Deploying a FluxCD Project to the cluster / installing the Agent with Flux

See the [dedicated flux docs](flux.md).
