# Developing KhulnaSoft with KDK on Gitpod

KDK can be used with [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) using the KhulnaSoft
[Gitpod integration](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/integration/gitpod.html).

The main advantage of running the KDK in Gitpod is that you don't have to worry about
your local environment, installing dependencies, and keeping them up to date. With
Gitpod, you can run a pre-configured KDK instance in the cloud, which also makes it
possible to contribute, no matter how powerful your machine is. You could even just use
an iPad!

- [How to get started](#how-to-get-started)
- [How to update the Gitpod KDK Docker image](#how-to-update-the-gitpod-kdk-docker-image)

## How to get started

**If you are a KhulnaSoft team member**, either:

- Open [this link](https://gitpod.io/#https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/khulnasoft/).
- Click the **Gitpod** button in the [KhulnaSoft repository](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/khulnasoft/).
  This might require you to [enable the Gitpod integration](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/integration/gitpod.html)
  in your user settings.

**If you are a community contributor**:

1. Fork the [KhulnaSoft repository](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/khulnasoft/),
1. Click the **Gitpod** button in the repository view of your fork.

Hint: If you don't see a "Gitpod" button, open the dropdown of the "Web IDE" split button.

![Gitpod button in repository view](img/gitpod-button-repository.jpg)

If you have never used Gitpod before, you must:

1. Create a new Gitpod account.
1. Connect the Gitpod account to your KhulnaSoft account.

After that is done, you just wait 7-8 minutes for the entire setup to finish, and
you'll see a notification on the bottom right corner to open the KDK UI, Open the port in browser.

![KDK in Gitpod](img/kdk-in-gitpod.jpg)

Sign in to KhulnaSoft using the default username `root` and password `5iveL!fe`. You must
immediately change that password after you log in the first time. Every new Gitpod workspace
requires you to change the password again. Now you are ready to make or review changes.

If you have questions about the UI or if you are curious have a look at:

- [Gitpod documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/).
- [KDK commands documentation](../kdk_commands.md).

## View the KhulnaSoft instance

After you have [started](#how-to-get-started) a Gitpod session, to view your running KhulnaSoft instance:

1. Select the **PORTS** tab.
1. Select URL in the **Address** column for port **3000**.

## Make the Rails web server publicly accessible

By default, only your web browser can access your KhulnaSoft instance. Other services can't
access your KhulnaSoft instance until you open port `3000`. You can open port `3000`, either:

- By using the Gitpod UI:

  1. Select the **PORTS** tab.
  1. Select the lock icon next to port `3000` and it will appear as an unlocked lock.

- By using the [Gitpod CLI](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-cli):

  1. Select the **TERMINAL** tab.
  1. Run `gp ports visibility 3000:public`.

## How to use KDK with Gitpod

The following are common tasks for using KDK in Gitpod.

### Check out branches

The easiest way to switch to another branch is to use the UI functionality:

1. Click on the current branch name in the blue bottom bar.

   ![Switching branch in Gitpod](img/switch-branch-gitpod.jpg)

1. A context menu appears with a list of other branches where you can type in
   the name of the branch you want to switch to and select it as soon as it appears in
   the list.

   ![Branch context menu in Gitpod.png](img/branch-context-menu.jpg)

Alternatively, you can also use the terminal to check out a branch:

```shell
cd /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit/khulnasoft
git fetch origin &&
git checkout -b "BRANCH_NAME" "origin/BRANCH_NAME"
```

Often your branch is behind the Ruby gems and JavaScript libraries of the `master` branch,
so after switching branches, make sure they are installed.

On the Gitpod console:

```shell
cd /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit/khulnasoft
bundle && yarn
```

Finally, you should restart KDK after switching branches, because changes on the branch (for example,
workers) mean a restart is required to have the feature work:

```shell
cd /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit
kdk restart
```

### Start a Rails console

To run the Rails console:

1. Select the **TERMINAL** tab.
1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   cd /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit/khulnasoft && ./bin/rails console
   ```

### View logs

To switch to the directory with Rails logs:

1. Select the **TERMINAL** tab.
1. Change into the KhulnaSoft log directory:

   ```shell
   cd /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit/khulnasoft/log
   ```

You can also tail logs from KDK services:

1. Select the **TERMINAL** tab.
1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   cd /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit && kdk tail
   ```

### Commit and push changes

If you have made changes to any of the files and want to push and commit them:

1. Navigate to the **Source Control: Git** tab in the left sidebar. There you also
   see all files that have been changed.

   ![Source Control Tab in Gitpod.png](img/source-control-gitpod.jpg)

1. In this view, you can then decide which changes you want to add to the commit.
   Usually that would be all files, so you can just stage all changes by clicking on
   the "Plus" icon that appears on hover next to the **Changes** section.
1. When that's done and you have also entered a commit message in the text area above,
   you can commit by clicking the checkmark icon at the top of the **Source Control**
   section.

   ![Stage and Commit workflow](img/stage-commit-icons.jpg)

1. Push your changes by using the **Synchronize changes** action in the bottom
   blue toolbar. If the Gitpod UI asks you which way you want to synchronize your
   changes, you can just choose **Push and pull**.

   ![Synchronize changes in Gitpod](img/synchronize-changes.jpg)

## Configure additional features

With Gitpod, the default configuration of the KDK is ready for you in just a couple of
minutes, and we are actively working on making sure that as many features work out of
the box. However, right now you still have to complete a couple of steps to enable
advanced features.

### Enable runners

You can create a runner with a Docker executor or a shell executor. You can also create multiple runners with different executors.

Ensure that you're using the 3000 port and that it's set to public. To change the port from private to public:

- In the GitPod UI:
  1. On the **Remote Explorer** tab, find the port name.
  1. Select the lock icon.
- In the GitPod VSCode UI:
  1. Select the **Ports** tab. The tab is usually at the bottom of the window.
  1. Find port 3000.
  1. Right-click **open (private)** and select **Make public**.

#### Option 1: Docker executor

1. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token) in Gitpod with `owner` access and `api` scope and copy it.
1. Add the PAT you created to this command in place of `$KHULNASOFT_TOKEN` and then run it in your terminal. This command starts Runner in a Docker container and uses the Gitpod IP address, a default image, and a PAT access token to register the new runner ([learn more about why a PAT is needed](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.html#creating-runners-programmatically)):

   ```shell
   docker run --rm -it -v khulnasoft-runner-config:/etc/khulnasoft-runner khulnasoft/khulnasoft-runner:latest register \
     --non-interactive \
     --url "http://10.0.5.2:3000/" \
     --token "$(curl -sX POST "http://10.0.5.2:3000/api/v4/user/runners" -H "private-token: $KHULNASOFT_TOKEN" --data runner_type=instance_type --data description=docker-runner | jq -r '.token')" \
     --executor "docker" \
     --docker-image alpine:latest \
     --description "docker-runner"
   ```

1. Start the runner container using the Docker volume as [documented](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/runner/install/docker.html#option-2-use-docker-volumes-to-start-the-runner-container).

   ```shell
   docker run -d --name khulnasoft-runner --restart always \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -v khulnasoft-runner-config:/etc/khulnasoft-runner \
     khulnasoft/khulnasoft-runner:latest
   ```

#### Option 2: Shell executor

1. On the left sidebar, expand the top-most chevron (**{chevron-down}**).
1. Select **Admin Area**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **CI/CD > Runners**.
1. Select **New instance runner** and be sure to check **Run untagged jobs** if you don't specify a tag list. Optionally fill out the rest of the form.
1. In the next screen, copy the command.
1. In the terminal, switch to the KDK directory `cd /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit`.
1. Run the copied command with the following added to the end `--config /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit/khulnasoft-runner-config.toml --non-interactive --executor shell`.
1. Run `khulnasoft-runner run --config /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit/khulnasoft-runner-config.toml`.

You should receive a confirmation message on the screen that your runner is ready to pick up jobs. If you create a new project, the
**Pages/Plain HTML** template contains a super simple and tiny pipeline that's great to
use to verify whether the runner is actually working.

### Enable feature flags

To enable feature flags:

1. [Start a Rails console in Gitpod](#start-a-rails-console).
1. Wait about 1 minute until you see the message that the development environment
   has been loaded.
1. Run `Feature.enable(:feature_flag)`, replacing `feature_flag` with the name of the
   feature flag you want to enable.
1. Leave the console by typing `exit` and hitting Enter.

### Enable the billing page

1. Open a [Rails console](rails_console.md).
1. Run `ApplicationSetting.first.update(check_namespace_plan: true)`.
1. Run `kdk restart` to apply the changes.

The billing page is now accessible at **Group > Settings > Billing**.

### Connect the Customer app to your Gitpod instance

Use the instructions in the [`customers-khulnasoft-com` project](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/customers-khulnasoft-com/-/blob/main/doc/setup/gitpod_installation.md).

### Use Advanced Search

To use Advanced Search, you must:

- Have a premium or higher license registered in the KDK.
- Enable Elasticsearch.

To enable Elasticsearch:

1. From the command line, navigate to `/workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit` and open
   `kdk.yml` for editing by using `cd /workspace/khulnasoft-development-kit && gp open kdk.yml`.
   The file might be empty.

1. Add the following lines and save the file:

   ```yaml
   elasticsearch:
      enabled: true
   ```

1. Run `kdk reconfigure`.
1. Run `kdk start elasticsearch`.

### How to test features only available in higher KhulnaSoft tiers

For information on enabling higher KhulnaSoft tiers in KDK to test out features, learn more about
[how to activate KhulnaSoft EE with a license file or key](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/administration/license_file.html#add-your-license-file-during-installation).

### How to test features only available on SaaS (KhulnaSoft.com)

By default KDK runs as self-managed, but can be switched to run as the SaaS version. For more information, see [Simulate a SaaS instance](https://docs.khulnasoft.com/ee/development/ee_features.html#simulate-a-saas-instance).

## How to update the Gitpod KDK Docker image

There are two Gitpod KDK Docker images that can be built:

- `registry.github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/gitpod-workspace:main`
- `registry.github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/gitpod-workspace:stable`

### `main` tag

We automatically build a new Gitpod KDK Docker image every day that's tagged as
`registry.github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/gitpod-workspace:main`.
The `main` tag is used because that's the name of the default Git branch for
the KDK.

### `stable` tag

When running [Gitpod for KhulnaSoft](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/khulnasoft), it uses the
[`registry.github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/gitpod-workspace:stable`](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/khulnasoft/-/blob/master/.gitpod.yml#L1)
Docker image which uses the `stable` tag.

### Promote `main` tag to `stable`

1. Visit [KDK's scheduled CI pipelines](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-development-kit/-/pipeline_schedules) and locate the last successful pipeline ID for the `Rebuild Gitpod workspace image` pipeline.
1. Use the pipeline ID to check if the KDK Gitpod `main` image was created.
1. Check the `verify-gitpod-docker-image` job succeeded to ensure KDK started successfully in KDK Gitpod `main` image.
1. Using the pipeline located in step 1, promote the KDK Gitpod `main` image to `stable` by selecting **Run** on the manual `deploy-gitpod-workspace-image` job once it is available.
