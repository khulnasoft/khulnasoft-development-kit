# Contributing to KhulnaSoft Development Kit

This document describes how to contribute code to KhulnaSoft Development Kit (KDK).

## Contributing new KDK features

Contribute new features to KDK by:

- Creating a new KDK command.
- Adding a new service for KDK to manage.
- Adding a new capability to existing KDK commands, setup, or service.

### Creating a new KDK command

KDK commands manage operations that affect the entire KDK environment. KDK commands should:

- Perform actions that impact multiple services or the overall KDK setup.
- Not be specific to a single service (for example, database migrations).

Existing `kdk` commands include:

- `kdk start` and `kdk stop` to start and stop all services.
- `kdk update` to update your KDK environment.
- `kdk doctor` to verify the overall health of your KDK setup.

Don't create a KDK command to do things such as:

- Populating data for a single service.
- Performing setup tasks specific to one service.
- Running database migrations for a single service.

Instead, use a Rake task in these cases because they are more appropriate for service-specific actions.

### Creating a new KDK-managed service or Rake task

Use Rake tasks for service-specific actions.

Don't create new service-specific Makefiles (for example, `Makefile.<service name>.mk`) because we're moving individual
Ruby services. Services are stored in `lib/kdk/services`.

Each Ruby service can implement hooks for:

- Setup
- Installation
- Updates

For complex setup procedures:

1. Create a dedicated Rake task.
1. Execute it as part of the setup hook.

When you create new KDK commands or Rake tasks, follow the existing patterns in the KDK codebase.
