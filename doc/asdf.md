# `asdf`

## What is `asdf`?

[`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) is a command line tool for installing and updating software such as Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node.js and many others.

`asdf` defers the management of installing and updating software to [plugins](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins).

The [KDK `.tool-versions` file](../.tool-versions) contains the specifics plugins and versions KDK requires.

## `asdf` benefits

- Written in Shell, which requires no additional software to get started.
- Cross platform support, including macOS and Linux.
- Many `asdf` plugins are available, like the ones listed above.
- Support for defining required software _and_ versions with a `.tool-versions` file.
- Allows team members to use the same exact versions of software.

## `asdf` limitations

- Some `asdf` plugins require software to be compiled from source which can at times fail or be slow.
- Some `asdf` plugins are not well maintained.
- Some software does not have `asdf` plugins, such as `jaeger` and `OpenLDAP`.
- The performance of `asdf` commands is decreased by the use of shims.
  See [Improve dependency management performance using `mise`](howto/mise.md) for an alternative drop-in replacement tool
  that does not require shims and provides a faster experience.

## Reason for `asdf` as the standard for installing software in the KDK

Before `asdf` was integrated into the KDK, the related software had to be installed manually. This offered great flexibility of choice for our users, but made things difficult for users who were inexperienced with installing the software requirements.

We chose `asdf` as the standard for installing software for the KDK because:

- It's the only cross platform solution that provides support for _all_ of the required software.
- It supports installing multiple versions of software, which is critical in the testing and verification before we move to newer versions of software, something other tools did not support.

## `.tool-versions` file

The `.tool-versions` file is a plaintext file that is typically checked into a project at the root directory, but can exist in any directory. The file describes the software and versions a project requires. If the file is present, `asdf` inspects the file and attempts to make the software and the version available at the command line.

The following is an example of a `.tool-versions` file:

```plaintext
# <software>   <default-version> <other-version(s)>
some-software  1.0.0             2.0.0
```

We can summarize the contents as we require `some-software` versions `1.0.0` and `2.0.0`, with `1.0.0` the default version to use.

The `.tool-versions` file describes the project's software requirements, but it does not install them. To install the project's software requirements, run:

```shell
asdf install
```

## How KDK manages the `.tool-versions` file

The KDK clones and updates many Git repositories, like [`khulnasoft`](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/khulnasoft), [`khulnasoft-workhorse`](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/khulnasoft/-/tree/master/workhorse), and [`gitaly`](https://khulnasoft.com/khulnasoft-org/gitaly). Each repository has their own software requirements that their `.tool-versions` files define.

KDK manages its direct asdf dependencies in its own `.tool-versions`
file. This file also contains dependencies like Redis or Postgres for
services managed by KDK that don't have its own KhulnaSoft-managed
repository.
